# FYP-StockEconomics
This is my final year project, which studies the relationship between S&P 500 and other economic factors, especially GDP with Python, utilizing the VAR model, Granger causality, impulse response function, variance decomposition for time series analysis. Through examining both the yearly and monthly data of the U.S.A, it becomes evident that many economic factors influence each other as S&P 500 and GDP correlates with each other. Hence, theoretical models need developing, considering that stock indices can be a good proxy of Tobinâ€™s q and the capital growth rate. Last but not least, this study reveals that stock indices have different mechanisms for different periods with high possibility.
